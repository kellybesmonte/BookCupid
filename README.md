# Book Cupid

Book Cupid is an interactive app that mimics the experience of popular dating apps such as Hinge, Bumble, and Tinder to find their next favourite book! The app will utilize simple questionnaires, Reactâ€™s swipe feature, and quirky illustrations to create a personalized book recommendation. Book Cupid is not about judging a book by its cover but instead, encouraging others to step out of their comfort zone and discover new voices in the book world. Our aim is to give a platform to voices and stories from marginalized communities and introduce them to new readers.
